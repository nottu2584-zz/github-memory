# Github Memory

A simple memory game with React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

This projects has been developed using yarn as a package manager, you can [see how to install yarn here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable).

1. Download this app release or source.
2. If needed, move the app folder to a place of your choice.
3. Run `yarn install` in the app folder and you are good to go.

## Considerations

Hi, my name is Xavier, and this is my attempt at a memory game. I have humbly used code from other game approaches that I thought that shared my view on how it should work or how it must be structured.

It is also the first time I have done unit testing with Jest (never finished before on other React apps) and I have used React Hooks as I feel more comfortable with them. Given time, I would certainly try to add Typescript to the mix just to cover type definitions and basic testing and develop some other jest tests that may fit.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

Installs app dependencies.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
